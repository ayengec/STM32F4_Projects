The devices feature three low-power modes:
• Sleep mode (Cortex®-M4 with FPU core stopped, peripherals kept running)
• Stop mode (all clocks are stopped)
• Standby mode (1.2 V domain powered off)

In addition, the power consumption in Run mode can be reduce by one of the following
means:
• Slowing down the system clocks
• Gating the clocks to the APBx and AHBx peripherals when they are unused.
